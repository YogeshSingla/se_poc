>Chapter 3. Bluetooth programming with Python - PyBluez</H1
><P
>&#13;Chapter 2 introduced the high level concepts needed to apply standard network
programming techniques to Bluetooth programming.  This chapter describes a
Python extension module that allows these concepts to be easily and
quickly implemented in just a few lines of code.  
</P
><P
>&#13;Python is a versatile and powerful dynamically typed object oriented language,
providing syntactic clarity along with built-in memory management so that the
programmer can focus on the algorithm at hand without worrying about memory
leaks or matching braces.  Although Python has a large and comprehensive
standard library, Bluetooth support is not yet part of the standard
distribution.  A well documented C API allows software
developers to create third-party extension modules that extend the language
capabilities and provide access to operating system resources not otherwise
exposed in Python.
</P
><P
>&#13;PyBluez is a Python extension module written in C that provides access to
system Bluetooth resources in an object oriented, modular manner.  It is
written for the Windows XP (Microsoft Bluetooth stack) and GNU/Linux (BlueZ
stack).

>&#13;PyBluez represents a bluetooth address as a string of the form
``xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", where each x is a hexadecimal character representing one
octet of the 48-bit address, with most significant octets listed first.
Bluetooth devices in PyBluez will always be identified using an address string
of this form.
</P
><P
>&#13;Choosing a device really means choosing a bluetooth address.
If only the user-friendly name of the target device is known, then two steps
must be taken to find the correct address.  First, the program must scan for
nearby Bluetooth devices.  The routine <TT
CLASS="literal"
>discover_devices()</TT
> scans for
approximately 10 seconds and returns a list of addresses of detected devices.
Next, the program uses the routine <TT
CLASS="literal"
>lookup_name()</TT
> to connect to each
detected device, requests its user-friendly name, and compares the result to
the target
name.  
</P
><P
>&#13;Since both the Bluetooth detection and name lookup process are probabilistic,
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>discover_devices()</TT
> will sometimes fail to detect devices that are
in range, and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>lookup_name()</TT
> will sometimes return <TT
CLASS="literal"
>None</TT
>
to indicate that it couldn't determine the user-friendly name of the detected
device.  In these cases, it may be a good idea to try again once or twice
before giving up.
