><P
>&#13;Once our client application has determined the address of the host machine it
wants to connect to, it must determine which transport protocol to use.  This
section describes
the Bluetooth transport protocols closest in nature to the most
commonly used Internet protocols.  Consideration is also given to how
the programmer might choose which protocol to use based on the application
requirements.
</P
><P
>&#13;Both Bluetooth and Internet programming involve using numerous different
transport protocols, some of which are stacked on top of others.  In
TCP/IP, many applications use either TCP or UDP, both of which rely on IP as
an underlying transport.  TCP provides a connection-oriented method of
reliably sending data in streams, and UDP provides a thin wrapper around IP
that unreliably sends individual datagrams of fixed maximum length.  There are
also protocols like RTP for applications such as voice and video communications
that have strict timing and latency requirements.
</P
><P
>&#13;While Bluetooth does not have exactly equivalent protocols, it does provide
protocols which can often be used in the same contexts as some of the Internet
protocols.

NAME="rfcomm-and-tcp"
>2.3.1. RFCOMM + TCP</A
></H2
><P
>&#13;The RFCOMM protocol provides roughly the same service and reliability
guarantees as TCP.  Although the specification explicitly states that it was
designed to emulate RS-232 serial ports (to make it easier for manufacturers
to add Bluetooth capabilities to their existing serial port devices), it is
quite simple to use it in many of the same scenarios as TCP.
</P
><P
>&#13;In general, applications that use TCP are concerned with having a
point-to-point connection over which they can reliably exchange streams of
data.  If a portion of that data cannot be delivered within a fixed time
limit, then the connection is terminated and an error is delivered.  Along
with its various serial port emulation properties that, for the most part, do
not concern network programmers, RFCOMM provides the same major attributes of
TCP.
</P
><P
>&#13;The biggest difference between TCP and RFCOMM from a network programmer's
perspective is the choice of port number.  Whereas TCP supports up to 65535
open ports on a single machine, RFCOMM only allows for 30.  This has a
significant impact on how to choose port numbers for server applications, and
is discussed shortly.

><P
>&#13;UDP is often used in situations where reliable delivery of every packet is not
crucial, and sometimes to avoid the additional overhead incurred by TCP.
Specifically, UDP is chosen for its best-effort, simple datagram semantics.
These are the same criteria that L2CAP satisfies as a communications protocol.

scheme, where unacknowledged packets are retransmitted.  There are three policies an application can use:

><LI
><P
>never retransmit </P
></LI
><LI

>retransmit until total connection failure (the default) </P
></LI

><P
>drop a packet and move on to queued data if a packet hasn't been
acknowledged after a specified time limit (0-1279 milliseconds).  
This is useful when data must be transmitted in a timely manner. </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>&#13;Although Bluetooth does allow the application to use best-effort communication
instead of reliable communication, several caveats are in order.
The reason for this is that adjusting the
delivery semantics for a single L2CAP connection to another device affects <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>&#13;all</I
></SPAN
> L2CAP connections to that device.  
If a program adjusts the delivery semantics for an
L2CAP connection to another device, it should take care to ensure that there
are no other
L2CAP connections to that device.  
Additionally, since
RFCOMM uses L2CAP as a transport, all RFCOMM connections to that device are
also affected.  While this is not a problem if only one
Bluetooth connection to that device is expected, it is possible to adversely
affect other Bluetooth applications that also have open connections.  
</P
><P
>&#13;The limitations on relaxing the delivery semantics for L2CAP aside, it serves
as a suitable transport protocol when the application doesn't need the
overhead and streams-based nature of RFCOMM, and can be used in many of the
same situations that UDP is used in.
</P
><P
>&#13;Given this suite of protocols and different ways of having one device
communicate with another, an application developer is faced with the choice of
choosing which one to use.  In doing so, we will typically consider the
delivery reliability required and the manner in which the data is to be sent.
As shown above and illustrated in <A
HREF="x95.html#protocol-table"
>Table 2-1</A
>, we
will usually
choose RFCOMM in situations where we would choose TCP, and L2CAP when we would
choose UDP.
