>&#13;Every Bluetooth chip ever manufactured is imprinted with a globally unique
48-bit address, which we will refer to as the <SPAN

>, and both address spaces are actually
managed by the same organization - the IEEE Registration Authority.  These
addresses are assigned at manufacture time and are intended to be unique and
remain static for the lifetime of the chip.  It conveniently serves as the
basic addressing unit in all of Bluetooth programming.  
</P
><P
>&#13;For one Bluetooth device to communicate with another, it must have some way of
determining the other device's Bluetooth address.  This address is used at all
layers of the Bluetooth communication process, from the low-level radio
protocols to the higher-level application protocols.  In contrast, TCP/IP
network devices that use Ethernet as their data link layer discard
the 48-bit MAC address at higher layers of the communication process and
switch to using IP addresses.  The principle remains the same, however, in
that the unique identifying address of the target device must be known to
communicate with it.
</P
><P
>&#13;In both cases, the client program will often not have advance knowledge of
these target addresses.  In Internet programming, the user will typically
supply a host name, such as <TT
CLASS="literal"
>csail.mit.edu</TT
>, which the client must
translate to a physical IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS).  In
Bluetooth, the user will typically supply some user-friendly name, such as ``My
Phone", and the client translates this to a numerical address by searching
nearby Bluetooth devices.

>&#13;Since humans do not deal well with 48-bit numbers like <TT
CLASS="literal"
>0x000EED3D1829</TT
> (in much the same way we do not deal well with numerical IP
addresses like 64.233.161.104), Bluetooth devices will almost always have a
user-friendly name.  This name is usually shown to the user in lieu of the
Bluetooth address to identify a device, but ultimately it is the Bluetooth
address that is used in actual communication.  For many machines, such as cell
phones and desktop computers, this name is configurable and the user can
choose an arbitrary word or phrase.  There is no requirement for the user to
choose a unique name, which can sometimes cause confusion when many nearby
devices have the same name.  When sending a file to someone's phone, for
example, the user may be faced with the task of choosing from 5 different
phones, each of which is named "My Phone".
</P
><P
>&#13;Although names in Bluetooth differ from Internet names in that there is no
central naming authority and names can sometimes be the same, the client
program still has to translate from the user-friendly names presented by the
user to the
underlying numerical addresses.  In TCP/IP, this involves contacting a local
nameserver, issuing a query, and waiting for a result.  In Bluetooth, where
there are no nameservers, a client will instead broadcast inquiries to see
what other devices are nearby and query each detected device for its
user-friendly name.  The client then chooses whichever device has a name that
matches the one supplied by the user.
