>&#13;It turns out that choosing which machine to connect to and how to connect are
the most difficult parts of Bluetooth programming.  In writing a server
application, once the transport protocol and port number to listen on are
chosen, building the rest of the application is essentially the same type of
programming most network programmers are already accustomed to.  A server
application waiting for an incoming Bluetooth connection is conceptually the
same as a server application waiting for an incoming Internet connection, and
a client application attempting to establish an outbound connection appears
the same whether it is using RFCOMM, L2CAP, TCP, or UDP.

>&#13;Furthermore, once the connection has been established, the application is
operating with the same guarantees, constraints, and error conditions as are
encountered in Internet programming.  Depending on the transport protocol
chosen, packets may be dropped or delayed.  Connections may be severed due to
host or link failures.  External factors such as congestion and interference
may result in decreased quality of service.  Due to these conceptual
similarities, it is perfectly reasonable to treat Bluetooth programming of an
established connection in exactly the same manner that as an established
connections in Internet programming.
