>Chapter 2. Bluetooth Programming Introduced</H1
><P
>&#13;This chapter presents an overview of Bluetooth, with a special emphasis on the
parts that concern a software developer.  Bluetooth programming is explained in
the context of TCP/IP and Internet programming, as the vast majority of network
programmers are already familiar and comfortable with this framework.  It is
our belief that the concepts and terminology introduced by Bluetooth are easier
to understand when presented side by side with the Internet programming
concepts most similar to Bluetooth.

>,
the Bluetooth specification is quite large and daunting to the novice
developer.  But upon closer inspection, it turns out that although the
specification is immense, the typical application programmer is only concerned
with a small fraction of it.  A significant part of the specification is
dedicated to lower level tasks such as specifying the different radio
frequencies to transmit on, the timing and signalling protocols, and the
intricacies needed to establish communication.  Interspersed with all of this
are the portions that are relevant to the application developer.  Although
Bluetooth has its own terminology and ways of describing its various concepts,
we find that explaining Bluetooth programming in the context of Internet
programming is easy to understand since almost all network programmers are
already familiar with those techniques.  We do not try to explain in great
detail the actual Bluetooth specification, except where it aids in
understanding how it fits in with Internet programming.
</P

>&#13;Although Bluetooth was designed from the ground up, independently of the
Ethernet and TCP/IP protocols, it is quite reasonable to think of Bluetooth
programming in the same way as Internet programming.  Fundamentally, they have
the same principles of one device communicating and exchanging data with
another device.

>&#13;Some of these components do not apply to all models of network programming.
In a connectionless model, for example, there is no notion of establishing
a connection.  Some parts can be trivial in certain scenarios and quite
complex in another.  If the numerical IP address of a server is hard-coded into
a client program, for example, then choosing a device is no choice at all.  In
other cases, the program may need to consult numerous lookup tables and perform
several queries before it knows its final communication endpoint.
